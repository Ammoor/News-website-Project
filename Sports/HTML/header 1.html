            The president of top-flight Turkish soccer club Ankaragücü has
            announced his resignation a day after he punched a FIFA-licensed
            referee in the face. “In order to avoid any further harm to the
            Ankaragücü club, Ankaragücü fans, the community I am in and my
            family, I would like to announce that I have resigned from the MKE
            Ankaragücü Presidency,” Faruk Koca said in a club statement posted
            on X, formerly known as Twitter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Referee Halil Umut Meler claimed that Koca also threatened to kill
            him following Ankaragücü’s match against Rizespor on Monday night.
            Meler says Koca punched him in the face under his left eye. Meler
            says he then fell to the ground where he was kicked by two others,
            according to a statement published by Turkey’s state-run news agency
            Anadolu.
            <br />
            “Faruk Koca, said to me [and the other officials], ‘I will finish
            you.’ Addressing me, he said, ‘I will kill you,’” Meler told
            Anadolu.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several photos and videos show Meler with a swollen left eye and a
            bag of ice as he walked off the field, surrounded by security with
            riot shields. According to public broadcaster TRT, he was
            transported to the hospital by ambulance. Yılmaz Tunç, the Turkish
            Minister of Justice, said on X that the three individuals who
            attacked the referee have been “arrested for the crime of,
            ‘injuring, on a sports field in a way that resulted in a fracture,
            [of] a public official who was performing their public duty.’”<br />
            Koca is among the three people arrested, per Tunç. Koca, however,
            has refuted the claims, saying he “slapped” Meler in the face.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This incident developed due to the referee’s wrong decisions and
            provocative behavior. My aim was to react verbally to the referee
            and spit in his face. Meanwhile, I slapped the referee in the face.
            The slap I gave does not cause a fracture,” Koca said, per Anadolu.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            “After the slap, the referee was standing about five-10 minutes … He
            stood for a second. Then [Meler] threw himself on the ground. They
            immediately removed me from the scene because I had a heart
            condition. I am not aware of any other incident that took place.”
            Mehmet Yörübulut, chief doctor of Acibadem hospital, said in a video
            posted on X that Meler has a small crack following the punch but
            there is no brain damage. Yörübulut said that he is hoping Meler
            will be discharged on Tuesday evening or on Wednesday.
          </p>

            The Turkish Football Federation has indefinitely postponed matches
            in all of the country’s leagues following the attack. During the 1-1
            draw at Eryaman Stadium in Ankara, Ankaragücü conceded an equalizing
            goal in the 97th minute, after which Koca ran onto the field and
            punched Meler in the face. The FIFA-licensed referee was eventually
            brought to his feet with the help of several players and security
            personnel before eventually being led away from the field. “We
            strongly condemn the inhumane and despicable attack on Halil Umut
            Meler, the referee of the match with a FIFA license, by self-aware
            criminals after the Trendyol Süper Lig match,” the Turkish Football
            Federation (TFF) said in a statement.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We are closely following Halil Umut Meler’s health condition and
            wish a speedy recovery to our valuable referee.” The federation then
            announced that the board of directors had agreed to indefinitely
            postpone matches in all leagues, while also adding that criminal
            proceedings have been initiated against those responsible for the
            “inhumane attack.” “The responsible club, the Club President, its
            managers and all the criminals who attacked Halil Umut Meler will be
            punished in the most severe way,” the federation said.

            When reached by CNN for comment, FIFA pointed to the statement
            condemning the attack its president, Gianni Infantino, posted on
            Instagram. “There is absolutely no place for violence in football,
            on or off the field,” Infantino wrote on his Instagram Stories,
            adding that Monday’s events were “totally unacceptable and have no
            place in our sport or society.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Without match officials there is no football. Referees, players,
            fans and staff have to be safe and secure to enjoy the game, and I
            call on the relevant authorities to ensure that this is strictly
            implemented and respected at all levels.” Meanwhile, Turkish
            Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya confirmed in a post on X that Koca
            was being treated at the hospital under the supervision of security
            forces. Yerlikaya also said that detention procedures would be
            carried out for Koca following his treatment, adding that two other
            individuals had already been arrested.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to CNN Türk, Koca told Beyaz TV that he “blacked out” and
            doesn’t remember his actions. “My brain went crazy, my eyesight
            blacked out! I don’t remember what I did!” Koca said. Turkish
            President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan condemned the attack in a statement
            posted on X Monday. “I condemn the attack on referee Halil Umut
            Meler after the MKE Ankaragücü-Çaykur Rizespor match played this
            evening, and I wish him a quick recovery,” Erdogan said. “Sports
            means peace and brotherhood. Sport is incompatible with violence. We
            will never allow violence to take place in Turkish sports.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Ankaragücü, the club whose president initiated the attack,
            apologized for the incident. “As MKE Ankaragücü Sports Club, we are
            saddened by the incident that took place this evening,” the club
            said. “We apologize to the Turkish football public and the entire
            sports community for the sad incident that occurred after the Çaykur
            Rizespor match at Eryaman Stadium.” Rizespor sent well wishes to
            Meler, saying: “We strongly condemn the undesirable events that
            occurred after the Ankaragücü match we played today. We convey our
            wishes to the entire referee community, especially the referee of
            the match, Halil Umut Meler, to get well soon.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Meler, 37, has been a FIFA-licensed referee since 2017. Galatasaray,
            one of the top clubs in the country which is currently competing in
            the UEFA Champions League, said they were “indescribably saddened”
            by the events and called for a review into what has become a growing
            issue in the country. “Tonight is the time to review and think about
            what Turkish football has done for all its stakeholders. No matter
            what has happened in the past, we must all come together today and
            act to solve the problems we are a part of,” Galatasaray said.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We would like to remind the entire football community that no
            victory or championship won is more valuable than the slightest pain
            experienced,” the team explained. Ankaragücü is 11th in the Turkey
            Süper Lig standings with 18 points and sits three places below
            Rizespor, which has claimed 22 points this season.
