          but doesn’t rule out appearing at 2026 World Cup

            Lionel Messi is focused on playing at next June’s Copa América in
            the USA, though the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner hasn’t completely
            ruled out appearing for Argentina at the 2026 World Cup, he told an
            ESPN/Star+ documentary “Champions, A Year Later.” “As long as I feel
            good and I can continue to deliver, I’m going to (continue playing
            with Argentina). All I’m thinking about today is getting to the Copa
            América and being able to play in it,” he said. “Then time will tell
            whether I’ll be at the World Cup or not. I’m going to be at an age
            (39) that normally doesn’t allow me to play in the World Cup. “I
            will always try to compete to the maximum and I am the first to know
            when I can be at that level and when I can’t.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Messi inspired Argentina to World Cup glory in 2022 on his fifth
            attempt, winning the Golden Ball for the tournament’s best player
            along the way and scoring twice in the final against France. That
            victory, along with a 2021 Copa América trophy, came after
            international glory had eluded Argentina and Messi for years, as
            they lost three major finals in a row – the 2014 World Cup, 2015
            Copa and 2016 Copa. “After suffering for so many years, now that we
            are experiencing a special moment that I have never experienced
            before, I want to enjoy it to the fullest,” Messi said.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I feel good within the group, which is very united, very strong. A
            group that enjoys being together. I want to take advantage of all
            that, without thinking two or three years ahead, which in football
            is a lot.” Since winning the World Cup in Qatar, Messi has moved
            across the Atlantic, joining MLS club Inter Miami and prompting a
            new wave of American interest in soccer.

              He added that he is “aware” he went “to a smaller league” when he
              joined the MLS but said “it’s very much a personal thing and the
              way you deal with it and compete.” Following Messi’s arrival in
              July, Inter Miami embarked on a club-record 12-game unbeaten run
              and won its first ever trophy, the Leagues Cup, but ended the
              campaign without a win in seven games, with Messi missing for some
              of that time through injury.

            <p>
              “Maybe we’ll do well in the Copa América and everything will work
              out for me to continue. Maybe not. It’s hard,” Messi said. “Being
              world champion changed me in the peace of mind knowing that, in my
              job, I could achieve everything.”
