          Having failed to score in his team’s previous two games, Mohamed Salah
          had to wait longer than many had expected for his milestone Liverpool
          goal. But on Saturday, with the Reds a goal down against Crystal
          Palace at Selhurst Park, the Egyptian found the net when it mattered
          most to score his 200th Liverpool goal and 150th in the Premier
          League, sparking a comeback 2-1 victory for his team. The 31-year-old
          is only the fifth player in the club’s history to score 200 goals or
          more, joining a selective group which includes Ian Rush, Roger Hunt,
          Gordon Hodgson and Billy Liddell. “The most important thing is we’ve
          won the game,” Salah told TNT Sports after the 2-1 win. “When we win a
          game and I score goals it’s a great feeling but, yeah, I’m happy with
          the record and happy for the team.” Liverpool had fallen behind to a
          Jean-Philippe Mateta penalty in the 57th minute, with the Video
          Assistant Referee (VAR) deeming that Jarell Quansah had fouled Mateta
          when trying to clear the ball. It was the ninth time Liverpool had
          fallen behind in a match this season, but no team in the Premier
          League has secured more than Liverpool’s 18 points from a losing
          position. Palace, a team struggling in the bottom-half of the league,
          was then reduced to 10-men when Jordan Ayew was sent off for two
          bookable offenses. Liverpool quickly capitalized with Salah scoring
          just over a minute later, before substitute Harvey Elliott netted the
          winner in added time with a brilliant strike from the edge of the box.
          The win moves Liverpool to the top of the table, though the Reds’ time
          on the summit might be temporary if Arsenal beats Aston Villa in the
          final Premier League game of the day.

            Though Liverpool dominated possession, Jurgen Klopp’s side was far
            from convincing until Salah sparked the revival. Until Palace’s
            opener neither team had posed much of a threat in front of goal,
            which might explain why the television cameras often panned to
            Hollywood star Hugh Jackman, watching the match from the stands, in
            the first half. And though Salah will deservedly dominate the
            headlines, much credit for the win should also go to Liverpool
            goalkeeper Alisson. He produced a stunning save from Jefferson Lerma
            in the first half, when the match was goalless, and then illustrated
            why he is regarded as one of the world’s best stoppers by preventing
            Joachim Andersen from leveling in the final minutes of the game.
