          Child safety groups and prosecutors criticize encryption of Facebook

          Meta submitted nearly 95% of 29m reports of child sexual abuse
          material in 2022 and encryption will make it harder to detect
        </h2>
        <div class="sub-articles">
          Meta’s decision to introduce end-to-end encryption for Facebook
          messages will hamstring the rescue of child sex trafficking victims
          and the prosecution of predators, according to child safety
          organizations and US prosecutors.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          This week, the tech giant announced it had begun rolling out automatic
          encryption for direct messages on its Facebook and Messenger platforms
          to more than 1 billion users. Under the changes, Meta will no longer
          have access to the contents of the messages that users send or receive
          unless one participant reports a message to the company. As a result,
          messages will not be subject to content moderation unless reported,
          which social media companies undertake to detect and report abusive
          and criminal activity. Encryption hides the contents of a message from
          anyone but the sender and the intended recipient by converting text
          and images into unreadable cyphers that are unscrambled on receipt.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Social media companies are legally obligated to send any evidence of
          child sexual abuse material they detect to the National Center for
          Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the US, which then forwards it
          to relevant domestic and international law enforcement agencies.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          “Encryption on platforms without the ability to detect known child
          sexual abuse material and create actionable reports will immediately
          cripple online child protection as we know it,” said an NCMEC
          spokesperson. “NCMEC anticipates the number of reports of suspected
          child sexual abuse from the larger reporting companies will plummet by
          close to 80%.”
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp,
          submitted nearly 95% of the 29m reports NCMEC’s CyberTipline received
          from tech companies in 2022. A large proportion of these tips depicted
          child sexual abuse material in which children are being raped, abused
          and sexually exploited, according to the organization.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          The identification and rescue of exploited children would be made more
          difficult by encryption, as investigators would often only be able to
          identify victims by gaining access to a suspect’s social media
          accounts and private messages, said Ali Burns, an assistant US
          attorney in Illinois.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          “To get the messages, it’s going to rely on us finding their physical
          phones. But as far as getting a tip if something happens, if those
          aren’t being monitored, it will definitely change the cases and what
          we’re currently made aware of,” Burns said. Burns has prosecuted cases
          of predators using Facebook and Messenger to groom teenagers. “It
          would make it more challenging to corroborate evidence, to be able to
          verify. I can see this being a challenge for law enforcement.”

          Civil rights groups argue, however, that end-to-end encryption
          protects individuals’ personal data and free expression. Creating a
          loophole in user protections for one use case inevitably leads
          governments and other bad actors to use those entry points for
          surveillance and other nefarious purposes, they argue.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          “This level of security not only protects individuals from
          cyber-attacks but also empowers citizens to communicate freely without
          fear of surveillance, censorship, and warrantless searches – whether
          by the government, Big Tech, data brokers, or anyone else,” read an
          October statement from the American Civil Liberties Union, a
          non-profit human rights organization.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Meta said in a statement to NBC: “We don’t think people want us
          reading their private messages so we have spent the last five years
          developing robust safety measures to prevent and combat abuse while
          maintaining online security. We continue to strengthen our enforcement
          systems to root out potentially predatory accounts.”
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          Messenger is no stranger to content depicting the abuse of children. A
          Guardian investigation in April revealed how Meta is failing to report
          or detect the use of its platforms for child trafficking
