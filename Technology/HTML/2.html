        Elon Musk says Disney boss should be ‘fired immediately’ amid X ad
        boycott
      </h2>
      <div class="sub-articles">
        Elon Musk has said the Disney chief executive, Bob Iger, should be
        “fired immediately” after the world’s biggest entertainment company
        joined an advertising boycott of his X platform.
        <br />
        Musk, the world’s richest man, has embarked on a series of outbursts
        against companies halting their ad campaigns on the site, formerly known
        as Twitter, after he endorsed an antisemitic tweet last month.
        <br />
        “Walt Disney is turning in his grave over what Bob has done to his
        company,” Musk said in a series of tweets. “He should be fired
        immediately.”
        <br /><br /><br />
        Advertisers including Disney, IBM and Apple have “paused” their ad spend
        on X, which Musk bought for $44bn in October last year, since the
        billionaire shared his support for a tweet accusing Jewish people of
        “hatred against whites”, describing it as “the actual truth”.
        <br />
        Last week, the Tesla and SpaceX chief executive issued a profanity-laden
        attack on advertisers joining the boycott in a widely shared interview
        at the New York Times DealBook summit.
        <br />
        “Don’t advertise,” Musk said. “If someone’s going to try to blackmail me
        with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself.”
        <br /><br /><br />
        He has denied his controversial tweet was antisemitic but has
        apologized, saying it might have been the “dumbest” thing he had ever
        shared on social media.
        <br />
        “I mean, look, I’m sorry for that … post,” he said. “It was foolish of
        me. Of the 30,000 it might be literally the worst and dumbest post I’ve
        ever done. And I’ve tried my best to clarify six ways from Sunday, but
        you know at least I think it’ll be obvious that, in fact, far from being
        antisemitic, I’m in fact philosemitic.”
        <br />
        The X owner subsequently visited Israel and met the prime minister,
        Benjamin Netanyahu, although they did not discuss the post or
        antisemitism.

        <br /><br /><br />
        Musk, who announced in July that ad revenue at X had halved, said in the
        interview that it had been a “hell of a year” and admitted he sometimes
        says “the wrong thing”.
        <br />
        Last month, he said he intended to launch a “thermonuclear lawsuit”
        against Media Matters accusing it of a “fraudulent attack” on X after
        the US media watchdog said it found ads run by major brands being placed
        alongside antisemitic content, including content praising Adolf Hitler
        and the Nazis.
        <br />
        Musk has also filed a civil law suit against the Center for Countering
        Digital Hate (CCDH), accusing the anti-hate-speech group of breaching
        X’s terms of service by scraping the site for data subsequently used as
        evidence in the nonprofit’s research. The CCDH has filed its own motion
        to dismiss the suit, claiming it is an attempt at censorship that is
        “riddled with legal deficiencies”.
        <br /><br /><br />
        In November 2022, Iger made a shock return as chief executive of Disney
        after his hand-picked replacement was ousted after a disastrous tenure
        that lasted less than three years. The 72-year-old had only officially
        retired as executive chair at the end of 2021.
        <br />
        During Iger’s initial 15-year tenure, Disney made a series of big
        acquisitions, including the Marvel film franchise, the Pixar animation
        studio and the Star Wars film franchise. He retired as chief executive
        in 2020, having delayed his exit several times to guide the company
        through the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic.
        <br />
        The company enjoyed a fivefold increase in market value under his
        leadership but after the appointment of Bob Chapek, who previously ran
        the theme park division, Disney’s share price plummeted and its battle
        to take on Netflix sent streaming losses soaring into the billions.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <div class="images">
          <img
            src=" https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0bd4a79f108b7753f92176e6ab516a6bc3fd058/75_173_4579_2749/master/4579.jpg?width=620&dpr=2&s=none"

        Disney suffered a rare setback at the box office recently, with the
        family film Wish and its latest Marvel offering bombing with audiences.
        <br />
        Musk, who tweeted that Iger “drops more bombs than a B-52”, also accused
        Disney of advertising on other social media platforms that hosted
        controversial content.
