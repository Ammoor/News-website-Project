        OpenAI to pay German media group Axel Springer to use its material,
        including stories behind paywalls
      </h2>
      <div class="sub-articles">
        <br />

        <br />
        Axel Springer, the publisher of Business Insider and Politico, said on
        Wednesday it was partnering with OpenAI, which will pay the German media
        group to allow ChatGPT to summarize current articles in responses
        generated by the chatbot.
        <br />
        “ChatGPT users around the world will receive summaries of selected
        global news content from Axel Springer’s media brands,” which also
        includes the German tabloid Bild, the two companies said in a statement.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The chatbot’s answers will include material otherwise kept behind a
        paywall and offer “links to the full articles for transparency and
        further information”, they said. Axel Springer will be paid for making
        its content available to the US artificial intelligence firm, a
        spokesman for the media group told AFP. The deal is valid for several
        years and does not commit either side to exclusivity, leaving them free
        to sign new agreements, the spokesman said without giving more detail.
        <br />
        Other media companies have taken the opposite tack, walling off their
        content from the enormous hunger of AI for text to ingest and imitate.
        CNN, the New York Times, Disney (which owns ABC), Bloomberg, and the
        Guardian have blocked ChatGPT’s web crawler from vacuuming up their
        content to train the chatbot on how humans write. OpenAI has been sued
        multiple times for allegedly using copyrighted works to train ChatGPT.
        The company denies the claims.

        Previous versions of ChatGPT could generate responses based on a dataset
        that only included information from 2021 and before. OpenAI has taken
        steps in recent months to advance the chatbot’s capabilities to include
        more current information.
        <br />
        The Axel Springer spokesman said that with the advent of platforms such
        as Google and Facebook, media companies had missed the opportunity to
        establish a new source of income “and we are all still running after the
        money”.
        <br />
        The partnership with OpenAI was “the first of its kind”, Axel Springer’s
        CEO, Mathias Döpfner, said in the statement.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        “We want to explore the opportunities of AI empowered journalism – to
        bring quality, societal relevance and the business model of journalism
        to the next level,” Döpfner said.
        <br />
        Döpfner has previously warned that AI threatened to “replace”
        journalism, while the group has been pursuing its own AI-driven
        ventures.
        <br />
        OpenAI’s chief operating officer, Brad Lightcap, said in the statement
        that cooperation with Axel Springer would “help provide people with new
        ways to access quality, real-time news content through our AI tools”.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are able to generate essays, poems and more
        in a matter of a few seconds, but there are fears that the bots may
        recycle and spread false, nonsensical or offensive material in their
        answers to user queries – so-called “AI hallucinations”.
