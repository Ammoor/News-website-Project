            The Arena Group, publisher of Sports Illustrated, has fired the
            magazine’s CEO not long after it was revealed Sports Illustrated had
            published articles written by fake authors with AI-generated
            headshots and biographies.
            <br />
            The Arena Group’s board announced on Monday that CEO Ross Levinsohn
            had his employment terminated, with Manoj Bhargava named as interim
            chief executive. The board said it followed a meeting on actions to
            “improve the operational efficiency and revenue of the company”.
            <br />
            The release did not mention the AI scandal from November, which was
            spurred by an investigative report published by the science and
            technology news publication Futurism. Among fake profiles uncovered
            by Futurism was that of purported author “Sora Tanaka” which claims
            she is a product reviewer. The page said: “Sora has always been a
            fitness guru, and loves to try different foods and drinks. Ms Tanaka
            is thrilled to bring her fitness and nutritional expertise to the
            Product Reviews Team, and promises to bring you nothing but the best
            of the best.”
            <br />
            Tanaka is not a real person.

            The Arena Group, which acquired Sports Illustrated in 2019, denied
            the allegations, and said the articles in question were sourced
            commercial content from a third-party advertising company, AdVon
            Commerce.
            <br />
            A spokesperson for the Arena Group wrote in a statement at the time:
            “Today, an article was published alleging that Sports Illustrated
            published AI-generated articles. According to our initial
            investigation, this is not accurate.
            <br />
            “A number of AdVon’s e-commerce articles ran on certain Arena
            websites. We continually monitor our partners and were in the midst
            of a review when these allegations were raised. AdVon has assured us
            that all of the articles in question were written and edited by
            humans … However, we have learned that AdVon had writers use a pen
            or pseudo name in certain articles to protect author privacy –
            actions we strongly condemn – and we are removing the content while
            our internal investigation continues and have since ended the
            partnership.”
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            The company cut ties with AdVon and removed its content from Arena
            websites.
            <br />
            Sports Illustrated, first published in 1954, is known as well for
            its swimsuit issues, often featuring covers of fashion models,
            athletes, and other celebrities in bikinis. But, as Futurism noted,
            it also once published contributions from famed writers such as
            William Faulkner and John Updike.
            <br />
            After a round of layoffs earlier this year, Levinsohn indicated that
            Sports Illustrated would incorporate AI into its journalism, but
            said it would never replace journalism.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            “While AI will never replace journalism, reporting, or crafting and
            editing a story, rapidly improving AI technologies can create
            enterprise value for our brands and partners,” Levinsohn said in
            February.
            <br />
            Last week Arena terminated the employment of operations president
            and COO Andrew Kraft, media president Rob Barrett, and corporate
            counsel Julie Fenster.
            <br />
            Bhargava is the founder of the company behind the 5-Hour Energy
            Drink product.
