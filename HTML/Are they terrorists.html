      <h1 class="titles-of-sub-articles">What is Hamas?</h1>
      <div class="sub-articles">
        Hamas is an Palestinian resistance organization that controls the Gaza
        Strip. Hamas’ 1988 charter states: “Hamas rejects any alternative to the
        full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea” —
        i.e., the annihilation of Israel. The charter says: “The Day of Judgment
        will not come about until Muslims fight Jews and kill them.”
        <br /><br />Hamas later issued a new policy document, which did not
        replace or supersede its original charter, that included more coded
        language with calls for “resisting the occupation with all means and
        methods.” <br /><br />Since conquering the Gaza Strip by force in 2007,
        Hamas has maintained a standing army of fighters and an arsenal of light
        arms, mortars, rockets, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, drones,
        and more. <br /><br />

      <h1 class="titles-of-sub-articles">Why does Hamas control Gaza?</h1>
      <div class="sub-articles">
        Israel took control of the Gaza Strip after the Six-Day War in 1967. In
        2005, under U.S. pressure, then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
        unilaterally withdrew from the coastal enclave, removing every Israeli
        town, including every citizen, soldier, and grave. <br /><br />The
        Palestinian Authority (PA) ruled Gaza for two years, until 2007, but
        because of some disagreements between the Palestinian Authority and
        Hamas leaders, The Palestinian Authority (PA) decided to be content with
        ruling the West Bank and leaving Gaza under control of Hamas leaders.

        Is Hamas a designated terrorist entity?
      </h1>
      <div class="sub-articles">
        The United States designated Hamas as a Foreign Terrorist Organization
        in 1997, freezing its U.S.-based assets, barring members from entering
        the country, and banning the provision of “material support or
        resources.” <br /><br />The U.S. government subsequently sanctioned
        Hamas-related charities and senior Hamas members and blocked funds
        related to Hamas activity. Israel, the United Kingdom, Canada,
        Australia, New Zealand, and 15 European states have also sanctioned some
        or all of Hamas. <br /><br />

        ANKARA, Oct 25 - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, in his strongest
        comments yet on the Gaza conflict, said on Wednesday the Palestinian
        militant group Hamas was not a terrorist organisation but a liberation
        group fighting to protect Palestinian lands. <br /><br />"Hamas is not a
        terrorist organisation, it is a liberation group, 'mujahideen' waging a
        battle to protect its lands and people," he told lawmakers from his
        ruling AK Party, using an Arabic word denoting those who fight for their
        faith. <br /><br />Unlike many of its NATO allies and the European
        Union, Turkey does not consider Hamas a terrorist organisation and hosts
        members of the group on its territory. Ankara backs a two-state solution
        to the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. <br /><br />Erdogan also
        slammed Western powers for supporting Israel's bombing of Gaza and
        called for an immediate ceasefire, the unhindered entry of humanitarian
        aid into Gaza and for Muslim countries to work together to stop the
        violence. <br /><br />"The perpetrators of the massacre and the
        destruction taking place in Gaza are those providing unlimited support
        for Israel," Erdogan said. "Israel's attacks on Gaza, for both itself
        and those supporting them, amount to murder and mental illness."

        When the Israeli prisoners were released as part of the exchange deal
        between the occupation and the Palestinian resistance factions, their
        relatives revealed positive details regarding the conditions of their
        detention in the Gaza Strip. However, in light of the media blackout
        imposed on the events, the Israeli “Walla” website revealed a report
        presenting testimonies from Prisoners' families. <br /><br />After
        meeting the 13 prisoners who were released, a relative quoted one of the
        prisoners about his period of detention in Gaza, saying: “At first they
        were not with many people, and at some point more were added to them.
        They had radio and television there, and they could hear... News from
        Israel. <br /><br />“They did not go through anything unpleasant, they
        were treated humanely, and there were no horror stories that we thought
        there were,” a relative confirmed, citing another released elderly
        prisoner. <br /><br />Professor Gilat Livni, Director of the Department
        of Returned Children at Schneider Hospital, said: "The released
        abductees talked about the 'experiences' they went through." We don't
        ask many questions, but they: "They tell stories and we listen to them,
        and sometimes we cry with them, but I can't share the stories."
        <br /><br />Tel Aviv asked all released Israeli prisoners not to speak
        to the media, after two female prisoners who were released several weeks
        ago revealed that they had been treated humanely, which belies the
        occupation’s narrative that describes resistance fighters and the people
        of Gaza as “human animals.” <br /><br />The Israeli settler, Yocheved
        Lifshitz, who was released by the Al-Qassam Brigades, on October 23,
        reported how resistance members treated her during her detention period
        inside the Gaza Strip, and confirmed that she was not subjected to
        abuse. <br /><br />Lifshitz said: “Hamas treated us with kindness, met
        all our needs, and I underwent a medical examination during my
        detention,” adding that the Al-Qassam members “assured me that they were
        Muslims, and would not harm us, and we ate the same food as them,” as
        she put it. <br /><br />

        The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation said that Tel Aviv "received a list
        of names of the second batch of prisoners to be released, from among
        those detained in the Gaza Strip." <br /><br />In turn, the Hebrew
        Channel 12 reported that 13 Israeli prisoners, including women and
        children, are scheduled to be released. <br /><br />The first temporary
        humanitarian truce for 4 days between Israel and the Palestinian
        factions entered into force, since the outbreak of the bloody aggression
        launched by Israel against the Gaza Strip since last October 7.
        <br /><br />The temporary humanitarian truce agreement includes the
        release of 50 Israeli prisoners from Gaza in exchange for the release of
        150 Palestinians from Israeli prisons, and the entry of hundreds of
        trucks loaded with humanitarian, relief, medical and fuel aid to all
        areas of the Strip. <br /><br />

        In the end, there is a big difference between the owner of the land and
        the usurper of that land, between the owner of the right and the owner
        of wrongdoing, between those who have morals and those who have no
        morals. <br /><br />Hamas was not created to harm innocents and
        civilians, but to resist the violations of this occupier against the
        landowners. <br /><br />
