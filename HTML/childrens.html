        Gaza has been under blockade for 16 years so children have grown up
        facing deprivation and conflict. <br /><br />
        Children living in Gaza have never known anything but overcrowding,
        shortages, conflict and danger. <br /><br />It’s been 18 years since the
        then Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, moved all Israel’s settlers
        and military personnel out of the Gaza Strip. The country’s official
        narrative then became that they were no longer an occupying force.
        <br /><br />But two years later, following the election of Hamas, the
        Israeli government imposed a blockade on the entire Gaza Strip. So
        today’s 18-year-olds have suffered in a state of privation for pretty
        much their whole lives. <br /><br />Relocation of settlers and soldiers
        and the imposition of the blockade did not release Israel from its
        responsibility under international law towards the civilian population
        in Gaza. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross,
        Israel is still “bound by certain obligations under the law of
        occupation”. As detailed in article 55 of the fourth Geneva convention,
        this includes ensuring that the population of Gaza receives food,
        medicines and other basic goods. <br /><br />
        But over recent days the Israeli government has tightened the blockade
        so that even commodities essential for survival are denied to the
        civilian population. As researchers on the protection of children in
        Gaza, we – the authors of this article – are receiving messages from
        families that they are surviving on bread and contaminated water.
        <br /><br />The world is learning, almost in real time, about the impact
        on the children of Gaza of the latest siege-like conditions imposed by
        Israel in the wake of Hamas’ attacks. The lack of water and food is
        inevitably affecting the young more immediately and more severely than
        adults. <br /><br />Those children who fall sick or are injured seek
        treatment in a collapsing health system, with multiple facilities
        attacked. Those still functioning must manage an impossible level of
        demand along with a drastic shortage of medicine. In such circumstances
        many children are vulnerable to severe harm and death. <br /><br />

      <div class="sub-articles">
        But it would be a mistake to assume that even prior to the current
        tightening of the blockade, children in Gaza enjoyed healthy lives.
        Within the densely populated Gaza Strip, the health needs of children
        have grown exponentially due to the conditions of the Israeli blockade.
        <br /><br />
        Regular exposure to direct military attacks affects both the physical
        and mental health of the young. Older children will have experienced six
        wars including the current one in their brief lifetimes (2008-9, 2012,
        2014, 2021, 2022 and 2023). <br /><br />Since Israel imposed its
        blockade in 2007 up until the current war, Defense for Children
        International - Palestine (DCIP), a Palestinian human rights
        organisation specifically focused on child rights, has counted 1,189
        Palestinian children killed in Gaza by Israeli military attacks. These
        wars have also created long-term threats to children’s survival and
        wellbeing. In the aftermath of each war, Israel has tightened access to
        Gaza via the main commercial crossing for construction materials,
        generators and water. <br /><br />

        Without these materials, it has been impossible to clear the debris
        fully, and to rebuild homes, schools, hospitals and public spaces. The
        lack of reconstruction poses severe risks to children playing outside.
        <br /><br />A report conducted by the UN Environment Programme following
        the 2008-9 war highlighted the serious health issues due to the debris
        that would particularly affect children. Polluted water supplies,
        contaminated soil, extensive rubble, including exposed metal rods, have
        all created grave risk for the young. <br /><br />

      <h1 class="titles-of-sub-articles">Crumbling infrastructure</h1>
      <div class="sub-articles">
        Blockade has also made it impossible to develop vitally needed
        infrastructure. The provision of clean water and adequate sewage and
        waste disposal requires massive investment to meet the needs of the
        population. Meanwhile, the electricity shortages and shortage of
        sanitation structures mean that the sea in Gaza is highly contaminated
        by sewage and poorly treated wastewater. <br /><br />With very few safe
        public play spaces for children, the beach is one place that many have
        turned to for relief. According to a 2018 report by the RAND
        Corporation, however, water-related diseases are a primary cause of
        child and infant mortality in Gaza. <br /><br />Some children require
        complex medical care that is not available in Gaza. Under international
        law, children’s access to adequate medical care is the responsibility of
        Israel. According to human rights organisations, requests for medical
        permits for children to access necessary care in Israel are routinely
        denied. <br /><br />The need for rehabilitative support for disabled
        children grew in 2018 and 2019 when thousands of children and youth
        participated in demonstrations during the “great march of return”.
        Israeli forces responded with live and rubber bullets, killing 46 and
        injuring nearly 8,800 children. Many children who sustained
        life-altering injuries, including loss of limbs, were not granted
        permits to leave Gaza to receive the rehabilitative care they required.

        Palestinian doctors, nurses, other medical practitioners, social workers
        and civil society organisations have spent 16 years doing their utmost
        to provide for the health and wellbeing of Palestinian children in Gaza
        under blockade. <br /><br />Despite multiple evacuation orders from the
        Israeli military in the past week, hospital staff continue to work
        around the clock to save lives. Yet health workers and facilities are
        under attack. Meanwhile DCIP is reporting that in the past week more
        than 1,000 Palestinian children have been killed. <br /><br />It must be
        understood that Israel’s actions in the last week –- termed as “ethnic
        cleansing” by UN human rights officials –- are an extension of 16 years
        of killing both children’s bodies and their hopes through its blockade.
