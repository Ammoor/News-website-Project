      <div class="sub-articles">
        Abu Akleh was born into a Christian Palestinian family in Jerusalem. Her
        father, Nasri Abu Akleh, was from a Greek Melkite family in nearby
        Bethlehem, while her mother, Louli (née Zakaria) Abu Akleh, belonged to
        a Greek Orthodox family from Jerusalem. Abu Akleh never married, but she
        remained close to her brother, Anton (“Tony”) Abu Akleh, and his
        children, who referred to her as a “second mom.”<br /><br />Born four
        years after East Jerusalem was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day War
        (1967), Abu Akleh belonged to an uncertain generation of Jerusalemites.
        Jordan still claimed sovereignty over East Jerusalem, and most of its
        residents found it more beneficial to retain Jordanian passports than to
        apply for the rights and protections of Israeli citizenship. The
        arrangement of permanent resident status while holding Jordanian
        passports allowed Palestinian Jerusalemites to remain connected to their
        families, and to Palestinian society more broadly, without losing their
        homes or their neighbourhoods. But it also made them vulnerable to the
        possibility that their residency could be revoked at any time. They were
        also left with a limited voice in policy making that affected their
        neighbourhoods.<br /><br />For a period of Abu Akleh’s childhood, she
        lived with relatives in New Jersey. She obtained American citizenship
        and visited the United States with some frequency, but she continued to
        reside in Jerusalem in her childhood neighbourhood of Beit Hanina.
        <br /><br />Abu Akleh went to Jordan in 1987 to study architecture at
        the Jordan University of Science and Technology. In December of that
        year, the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising, broke out after years
        of mounting frustration toward Israeli policies. Eager to get the
        Palestinians’ story out to the world, Abu Akleh eventually decided to
        transfer to nearby Yarmouk University to study journalism. In a clip
        broadcast on Al Jazeera in the months before her death, she told
        viewers: “I chose journalism to be close to the people. It might not be
        easy to change the reality, but at least I could bring their voice to
        the world.”

        Career and prominence as “the voice of Palestine”
      </h1>
      <div class="sub-articles">
        After graduating, Abu Akleh worked a brief stint at the United Nations
        Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).
        The start of her journalistic career coincided with the Oslo Accords
        (1993), a bilateral peace agreement between the government of Israel and
        the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) that arranged for
        Palestinian self-governance in exchange for peace. With a two-state
        solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict achieving international
        legitimacy, a new Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation was established
        with international funding in 1994. Through it, a new radio station was
        established called the Voice of Palestine, in which Abu Akleh played a
        foundational role. Her early career also included gigs at Amman
        Satellite Channel and Radio Monte Carlo Moyen-Orient. <br /><br />In
        1997 Abu Akleh joined Al Jazeera, an Arabic-language cable television
        news network that had been founded one year earlier by the Qatari emir.
        As a field correspondent, she provided an international audience with
        insight directly from inside the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She rose
        to prominence with the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000, as
        Palestinians and Arabs worldwide gathered around their television sets
        for the latest updates on the violence. Abu Akleh’s residency in
        Jerusalem, moreover, gave her the ability to report to the Arab world
        from within Israel, including during the Lebanon War in 2006. Although
        she often reported in tense and dangerous situations, she remained
        composed, collected, and focused on explaining the situation around her
        in a calm and articulate manner. In a reflection of her reputable
        reporting during the intifada, soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces
        (IDF) reportedly mimicked her over a loudspeaker during the IDF’s 2002
        siege of Ramallah: “Curfew is declared, Shireen Abu Akleh, Al Jazeera.”
        <br /><br />Apart from her work for Al Jazeera, Abu Akleh helped train
        students in journalism in the West Bank. She worked at Birzeit
        University’s Media Development Center near Ramallah and taught media
        courses at the university. But she also remained cognizant that even
        established journalists must keep up with the ever-transforming
        landscape of their field: in 2020 she completed a program in digital
        journalism at the university.

      <h1 class="titles-of-sub-articles">Death and funeral</h1>
      <div class="sub-articles">
        In early 2022 the West Bank began seeing its worst cycle of violence
        since the second intifada ended in 2005. Abu Akleh was reporting from
        Jenin on May 11 as the IDF was conducting a raid in the town. Despite
        wearing protective gear and a vest that prominently displayed the word
        “PRESS,” she was shot in the head. Israeli officials initially indicated
        that she was caught in the firefight and was killed by a Palestinian
        gunman. But independent investigations corroborated Al Jazeera’s claims
        that she was shot by an IDF soldier and that no Palestinian gunmen were
        in her vicinity. Under international pressure, the IDF later backtracked
        and acknowledged that the bullet that killed Abu Akleh likely came from
        one of its soldiers, but no disciplinary actions were taken.
        <br /><br />Abu Akleh’s funeral took place on May 13 in the eastern part
        of Jerusalem. It drew hundreds of mourners bearing Palestinian flags and
        chanting slogans of Palestinian national solidarity. Israeli police
        intervened to prevent the mourners from processing with her coffin on
        foot from a morgue in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood to the Cathedral
        of the Annunciation in Jerusalem’s Old City, where funeral rites were to
        be held. In the ensuing confrontation, pallbearers briefly lost control
        of the coffin, the lower end of which nearly fell to the ground. Abu
        Akleh was laid to rest later that day in a cemetery on Mount Zion, near
        the burial sites of her father, mother, and maternal grandfather.
